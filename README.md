# Gruniozerca
This is a Gruniozerca clone written in Python. Control Grunio and collect yummy carrots to fill his infinite tummy! All you need to install alongside Python is pygame. You can do that by opening cmd and typing in "pip install pygame".

All assets (except for the title screen which I only modified a bit and the sound effects and music) were created by me.
